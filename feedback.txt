Functionality and Implementation Quality
----------------------------------------

I am really impressed by what you have managed to achieve. The system has a wide range of features and is easy to use.

There are a couple of niggles from the user point of view:

- stars sometimes disappear when reloading the page but I am not sure I can figure out exactly when.

- When replying the message does not appear - it shows only after a refresh.

- I cannot seem to upload my own picture.

- A refresh button or auto-refresh would be quite handy generally.

Looking at the code:

- In craigServer.js you create a module for the craigServer but do not place all the variables and function into it - why? This is done better in the client code.

- You are opening a new connection to the database each time a request comes This is somewhat inefficient - use the connection pool created and stored in the db variable in the craicServer closure.

- There are some improvements that could be made to the API. For example, you have a URL /addReply/:messageID - this countains a verb, a sure sign that you are not following the RESTful approach. Instead, model this as POST /messages/:id/replies. The same applies all the other URLs that contain verbs.

- Why are you using an array as the data structure returned by the server instead of an object? Also, why the need to retrieve all the information in one go?

The code is very readable and well structured.

I found the discussion about the modeling of friendship relationships intriguing. It should be possible to model them without a linking collection but this would entail keeping a list of friends and a list of followers for each account. There are certainly disadvantages to this approach but the ease with which all the information about a given account could be retrieved is desirable. One thing I do wonder about is the performance implications of each approach - I can see it going either way under different scenarios.

Again, I am really impressed by the functionality you have managed to implement. Very well done.
